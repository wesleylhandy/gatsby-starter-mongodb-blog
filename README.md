Looking for contributors. The goal is the utilize MongoDB to store markdown as well as comments, users and sessions. So there will need to be a hybrid aspect to this application. I'm invisioning SSR of most recent posts and comments, with update via Sockets on load with current data, and passing of updates via sockets between builds. New builds on new posts? Or perhaps on a set schedule (to render more comments on load)? Perhaps Express Server handling the update of the blog after initial render with sessions, authentication, comments, sockets, etc. Would love input and ideas.

- fork this repo, and `git clone` your fork locally
